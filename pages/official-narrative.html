                        This is the version of history that has been taught to generations of Indian students.
                        It is not entirely false — but it is <strong>catastrophically incomplete</strong>.
                        It omits the most important context: what Bahlul Lodi's conquests actually <em>meant</em>
                        for millions of Hindu subjects who lived under his expanding Sultanate.

                <h2>What They <span class="text-crimson">Don't Tell You</span></h2>

                <h4>1. The Title "Shah Ghazi" — Not Just a Name</h4>
                <p>
                    Upon ascending the throne of Delhi in 1451, Bahlul took the title <strong>"Bahlul Shah
                        Ghazi"</strong>.
                    The word "Ghazi" in Islamic tradition specifically means a warrior who fights for the faith —
                    a holy warrior against infidels. This was not a ceremonial title; it was a statement of
                    religious and military intent. Textbooks mention his name but never explain the significance
                    of this title.
                </p>

                <h4>2. The Jaunpur Conquest — Not a "Unification"</h4>
                <p>
                    Bahlul Lodi's most celebrated achievement in textbooks is the annexation of the Jaunpur
                    Sultanate (finally achieved in 1479). This is presented as "bringing stability" to northern
                    India. What textbooks omit is that the Jaunpur Sultanate, under the Sharqi dynasty, had developed
                    its own relatively stable civilization. Bahlul's brutal military campaigns to annex it involved
                    <strong>decades of warfare, displacement of populations, destruction of local governance,
                        and the imposition of Afghan Sultanate authority</strong> over millions of people who had no
                    say in the matter.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Continuation of Jizya — Not "Tolerance"</h4>
                <p>
                    While Bahlul Lodi is described as "tolerant," he maintained the <strong>Jizya tax</strong> —
                    a discriminatory religious tax imposed on all non-Muslim subjects. This was not a minor
                    administrative detail; it was a <strong>systematic mechanism of religious oppression</strong>
                    that marked Hindus as second-class subjects in their own land. The fact that he did not
                    personally destroy temples (like his son would) does not make the continuation of institutional
                    religious discrimination "tolerance."
                </p>

                <h4>4. The Foundation for Sikandar Lodi's Atrocities</h4>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most significant omission is that Bahlul Lodi's legacy is inseparable from
                    what followed. His son, <a href="https://sikandarlodi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sikandar
                        Lodi</a>,
                    would go on to commit some of the most documented atrocities in Indian history —
                    destroying the sacred Krishna Janmasthan temple at Mathura, ordering idols to be given to
                    butchers as meat-weights, executing a Brahmin for expressing his faith, and earning the
                    title <strong>"But-Shikan" (Destroyer of Idols)</strong>. Bahlul Lodi built the
                    machinery — his son used it.
                </p>

                <h4>5. Afghan Supremacism Over Indian Society</h4>
                <p>
                    Bahlul Lodi's rule was fundamentally about establishing <strong>Afghan ethnic and political
                        supremacy</strong> over Indian society. He treated Afghan nobles as equals — but this was
                    a <em>tribal in-group dynamic</em>, not a universal principle. The same "equality" did not
                    extend to Hindu subjects, who remained under the oppressive Sultanate framework with
                    discriminatory laws, religious taxation, and no political voice.

                <h2>The <span class="text-saffron">Historiographical</span> Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The way Bahlul Lodi is taught in Indian schools is a case study in <strong>historiographical
                        manipulation through selective emphasis</strong>. By describing him as "tolerant" and
                    "humane," textbooks create a false impression that the Lodi dynasty was a benign period
                    in Indian history. This serves a specific ideological purpose:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It minimizes the impact of Sultanate rule on Hindu civilization</li>
                    <li>It disconnects Bahlul from the atrocities of his successors</li>
                    <li>It presents Islamic conquest as a neutral or even positive force</li>
                    <li>It makes the eventual British colonial narrative of "bringing order" seem more legitimate</li>
                    <li>It prevents Indians from understanding the structural nature of religious persecution</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    History is not just about individual rulers being "nice" or "cruel." It is about
                    the <strong>systems they built and perpetuated</strong>. Bahlul Lodi may not have
                    personally smashed idols, but he built, maintained, and expanded the system
                    that made idol-smashing state policy under his son.

                    history to serve political agendas.
