                    While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, history is subject to interpretation.

                <p>
                    This website presents historical content that may include descriptions of religious persecution,
                    military violence, and cultural destruction. These descriptions are drawn from primary historical
                    sources and are presented for educational purposes. The content is not intended to promote
                    hatred or violence against any community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is <strong>against any community</strong> — not against Muslims, Afghans, or
                    any modern group. It is against the <strong>documented historical actions</strong> of specific
                    rulers and the systems they created. We recognize the difference between a historical ruler's
                    policies and the communities that exist today.
