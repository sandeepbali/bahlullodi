                        Bahlul Lodi, an Afghan chieftain from the Lodi tribe, seizes the throne of Delhi
                        after the last Sayyid ruler, Alauddin Alam Shah, voluntarily abdicates in his favour.
                        Bahlul takes the title <strong>"Bahlul Shah Ghazi"</strong> — warrior for the faith.

                        Bahlul begins consolidating his authority over the regions immediately surrounding
                        Delhi. He suppresses rebellions among disloyal nobles and establishes Afghan tribal
                        dominance in the Sultanate administration. Local Hindu rulers are displaced from
                        positions of authority.

                        Bahlul launches military campaigns to suppress the rulers of Mewat and the Doab region.
                        These campaigns involve the subjugation of local Hindu chieftains who had asserted
                        independence during the weakening Sayyid dynasty. The local populations are subjected
                        to Afghan military authority.

                        The conflict brings devastation to the populations caught between two warring Sultanates
                        in the fertile plains of northern India.

                        Hindu kingdoms that had governed these regions for centuries are dismantled or rendered
                        vassal states. The Sultanate's administrative apparatus — including the Jizya tax —
                        is imposed across these newly conquered territories.

                        of the Jaunpur region — which had developed its own distinctive Indo-Islamic
                        architecture and scholarship — is extinguished under Lodi Sultanate control.
                        Jaunpur becomes a province ruled by Bahlul's appointees.

                <p>
                    When you read this timeline, a clear pattern emerges: Bahlul Lodi's 38-year reign
                    was a sustained military campaign to impose Afghan Sultanate authority across northern
                    India. Every conquest brought more territory — and more Hindu populations — under
                    the Sultanate's discriminatory religious and administrative framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The textbook narrative of "tolerance" is a selective reading that ignores the
                    <strong>structural violence</strong> of the system Bahlul built. His personal
                    "tolerance" is irrelevant when the system he maintained treated millions of
                    Hindus as second-class subjects.
