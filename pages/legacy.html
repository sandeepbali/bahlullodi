                    Bahlul Lodi's most consequential legacy is the <strong>dynasty itself</strong>.
                    The three Lodi Sultans ruled for 75 years (1451–1526), and their collective
                    impact on Indian civilization was profound:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bahlul Lodi (1451–1489):</strong> Founded the dynasty, conquered
                        Jaunpur, expanded Sultanate control across northern India, maintained the
                        institutional framework of religious discrimination.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://sikandarlodi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sikandar Lodi</a>
                            (1489–1517):</strong> Used the empire Bahlul built to launch systematic temple
                        destruction, religious persecution, and cultural devastation on an unprecedented
                        scale. Earned the title "But-Shikan" (Destroyer of Idols).</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://ibrahimlodi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ibrahim Lodi</a>
                            (1517–1526):</strong> The last Lodi Sultan, whose tyrannical rule led to his own
                        nobles inviting Babur to invade — leading to the Battle of Panipat (1526) and the
                        establishment of the Mughal Empire.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="blockquote">
                    Without Bahlul Lodi, there is no Sikandar Lodi. Without the empire Bahlul built,

                    Brahmin executed for his faith. The founder is responsible for what the
                    foundation enables.

                <h2>Ongoing <span class="text-crimson">Temple Disputes</span></h2>
                <p>
                    The destruction wrought by the Lodi dynasty — particularly under
                    <a href="https://sikandarlodi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sikandar Lodi</a> —
                    continues to generate legal and social conflict in modern India:
                </p>

                <h4>The Mathura Krishna Janmasthan Case</h4>
                <p>
                    The Krishna Janmasthan temple at Mathura — one of the holiest sites in Hinduism,
                    believed to be the birthplace of Lord Krishna — was destroyed by Sikandar Lodi
                    around 1490 CE. The Shahi Idgah mosque was later constructed adjacent to the
                    remnants of the temple. This case is currently active in Indian courts, with
                    Hindu organizations seeking the reclamation of the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This temple was destroyed by the empire that Bahlul Lodi built. Without his
                    dynasty, this destruction — and the centuries-long conflict it created —
                    would not exist.
                </p>

                <h4>The Broader Reclamation Movement</h4>
                <p>
                    Across India, hundreds of temple sites remain under structures built during
                    the Sultanate and Mughal periods. The legal, social, and political battles
                    over these sites are a <strong>direct consequence</strong> of the policies
                    that Bahlul Lodi's dynasty, and previous Sultanates,
                    implemented against Hindu civilization.

    <!-- Historical Revisionism -->

                <h2>Historical <span class="text-saffron">Revisionism</span></h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most insidious legacies of the Sultanate period is the
                    <strong>historiographical whitewashing</strong> that followed. For decades,
                    Indian textbooks have:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Described Bahlul Lodi as "tolerant" without acknowledging the system of oppression
                        he maintained</li>
                    <li>Presented the Lodi dynasty as a period of "stability" without documenting the
                        cost of that stability to Hindu subjects</li>
                    <li>Disconnected Bahlul from the atrocities of his son Sikandar Lodi</li>
                    <li>Minimized the role of the Jizya tax as a mechanism of religious oppression</li>
                    <li>Failed to teach students about the extent of temple destruction during the
                        Sultanate and Mughal periods</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This revisionism is not accidental — it is the result of deliberate choices
                    by historians, textbook committees, and educational institutions influenced by
                    political considerations. For a detailed analysis, see Arun Shourie's

                <h2>The <span class="text-crimson">Naming</span> Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most visible modern legacies of the Lodi dynasty is the
                    <strong>naming of public spaces</strong> after its rulers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lodi Gardens, New Delhi:</strong> A popular park containing the tombs
                        of Sayyid and Lodi dynasty rulers, including Muhammad Shah's tomb and
                        Sikandar Lodi's tomb. The park is a beloved recreational space — but few
                        visitors are aware of the documented history of the rulers memorialized there.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lodhi Road, New Delhi:</strong> One of Delhi's major thoroughfares,
                        named after the dynasty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lodi Colony, New Delhi:</strong> A residential neighborhood named
                        after the dynasty.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The normalization of the Lodi dynasty in Indian public life — through park names,
                    road names, and neighborhood names — reflects a society that has not fully
                    confronted the history of what these rulers did. Imagine if Germany had parks
                    and roads named after its most controversial historical figures — the cognitive
                    dissonance would be immediately apparent.
