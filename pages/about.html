                <h2>Our <span class="text-saffron">Mission</span></h2>
                <p>
                    This website exists for one reason: <strong>every Indian has the right to know their
                        true history</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For decades, Indian textbooks have presented a sanitized version of the Sultanate
                    period — one that minimizes the documented impact of Islamic rule on Hindu civilization,
                    culture, and heritage. Bahlul Lodi, the founder of the Lodi dynasty, is typically
                    described in a few paragraphs as a "tolerant" and "humane" ruler, with no mention
                    of the systemic religious discrimination he perpetuated, the military devastation
                    his campaigns caused, or the dynasty of destruction he founded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project aims to present the <strong>complete, documented, source-backed
                        historical record</strong> — not opinions, not assumptions, but facts drawn from
                    primary historical chronicles written by medieval historians, many of whom were
                    sympathetic to the Sultanate itself.

                <h2>Our <span class="text-saffron">Methodology</span></h2>
                <p>
                    We follow a rigorous methodology to ensure historical accuracy:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary sources first:</strong> All claims are derived from primary historical
                        chronicles — Tarikh-i-Daudi, Ferishta, Tabaqat-i-Akbari, Makhzan-i-Afghani, and others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-reference:</strong> We cross-reference claims across multiple sources to
                        ensure accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Context preservation:</strong> We present historical events in their full context,
                        including the social, political, and religious dimensions that textbooks omit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparent sourcing:</strong> Every significant claim is cited with its source.
                        Readers can verify any claim by consulting the original texts.</li>
                    <li><strong>No fabrication:</strong> We do not invent or embellish. The documented historical
                        record is sufficiently significant without fabrication.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p class="text-secondary" style="line-height:1.8;">
                        This website openly acknowledges its perspective: it presents history from the
                        viewpoint of the Indian civilization that was impacted by Sultanate rule. This is
                        not a neutral "both sides" presentation — because the destruction of a civilization's
                        temples, the taxation of its people for their religion, and the suppression of its
                        learning does not have "another side." We present facts. The facts speak for themselves.

                            Digant Sharma is the visionary behind the Bharat Files Initiative, a comprehensive
                            effort to document and educate Indians about their true history. His mission
                            is to ensure that the documented historical record — particularly regarding the
                            impact of Islamic rule on Indian civilization — is accessible to every Indian citizen.

                            Through a network of educational websites, each focused on a specific historical
                            figure or period, the Bharat Files Initiative aims to fill the gaps left by
                            decades of selective historiography in Indian education.
