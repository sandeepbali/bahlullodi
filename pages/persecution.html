                <h2>The <span class="text-crimson">System</span> of Oppression</h2>
                <p>
                    The discussion of religious persecution under Bahlul Lodi requires understanding a
                    crucial distinction: the difference between <strong>personal tolerance</strong> and
                    <strong>institutional oppression</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Textbooks praise Bahlul Lodi's personal "tolerance" as if it negates the system he
                    operated. But a ruler who maintains and expands an oppressive system — even if he
                    personally does not add new cruelties — is still responsible for the suffering that
                    system inflicts. Bahlul Lodi maintained, expanded, and strengthened the Delhi
                    Sultanate's framework of religious discrimination. His "tolerance" was tolerance
                    <em>within</em> a system designed to oppress.

                <h2>The <span class="text-saffron">Jizya</span> Tax</h2>
                <p>
                    The Jizya was a <strong>poll tax levied exclusively on non-Muslim subjects</strong>.
                    Its implications were not merely financial — they were theological and political:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Religious marker:</strong> The Jizya explicitly identified Hindus as
                        second-class subjects whose right to live in their own land was conditional
                        on payment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic burden:</strong> For impoverished Hindu farmers, artisans,
                        and laborers, the Jizya was an additional tax on top of existing agricultural
                        and trade levies — paid solely because of their religion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humiliation ritual:</strong> Historical accounts describe the
                        collection of Jizya as deliberately humiliating, with non-Muslims required
                        to present payment in person, often in postures of submission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conversion incentive:</strong> By making non-Muslim status costly,
                        the Jizya created constant economic pressure to convert to Islam.</li>
                </ul>

                        As Bahlul Lodi expanded his empire — from Delhi to Jaunpur, from Punjab to
                        Rajasthan — the Jizya tax was imposed on every newly conquered Hindu population.
                        Each military victory meant millions more Hindu families subjected to this
                        discriminatory tax. Bahlul's "tolerance" consisted of not adding <em>new</em>
                        restrictions on top of a system that was already fundamentally oppressive.

    <!-- Islamic Legal Framework -->

                <h2>The Sultanate's <span class="text-saffron">Legal Framework</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Under the Delhi Sultanate, which Bahlul Lodi perpetuated and expanded, the legal
                    system was based on <strong>Islamic jurisprudence (Sharia)</strong>. This had
                    profound implications for Hindu subjects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unequal legal standing:</strong> Hindu testimony was worth less than
                        Muslim testimony in court proceedings</li>
                    <li><strong>Restrictions on worship:</strong> While temples were not always actively
                        destroyed, the construction of new temples was restricted or prohibited</li>
                    <li><strong>No political voice:</strong> Hindu subjects had no formal mechanism for
                        political representation within the Sultanate structure</li>
                    <li><strong>Property privileges:</strong> Muslim subjects had preferential access
                        to land grants, official positions, and state patronage</li>
                    <li><strong>Conversion pressures:</strong> While forced conversion was not consistently
                        applied, the entire legal and economic system incentivized conversion</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Bahlul Lodi did not create this system — but he <strong>maintained it, defended it,
                        expanded it, and passed it on</strong> to his son, who would weaponize it for
                    systematic religious persecution.

                <p>
                    The most devastating consequence of Bahlul Lodi's reign was what it enabled.
                    His son, <a href="https://sikandarlodi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sikandar Lodi</a>,
                    inherited the vast empire and military machinery that Bahlul built — and used it for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Destruction of the sacred Krishna Janmasthan temple at Mathura</li>
                    <li>Ordering idols to be given to butchers as meat-weights</li>
                    <li>Executing a Brahmin for stating that Hinduism was as true as Islam</li>
                    <li>Banning Hindus from bathing in the Yamuna at Mathura</li>
                    <li>Establishing Sharia courts even in small villages</li>
                    <li>Earning the title <strong>"But-Shikan" — Destroyer of Idols</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    None of this would have been possible without the dynasty, empire, and administrative
                    machinery that Bahlul Lodi built over 38 years. The persecution was not an aberration
                    from the system — it was the logical culmination of the system.
